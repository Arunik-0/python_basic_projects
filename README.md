# Python Basic Projects

This repository contains small Python programs created to demonstrate
my basic understanding of Python programming.

These projects focus on:
- Logic building
- Control structures
- Functions
- Lists and dictionaries

I created these projects as a chemical engineering student to show
basic programming skills useful for automation and problem-solving.
